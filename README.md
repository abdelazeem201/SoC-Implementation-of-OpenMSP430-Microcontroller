# SoC-Implementation-of-OpenMSP430-Microcontroller
The open- MSP430 is an open-source 16-bit microcontroller core written in Verilog, that is compatible with the Texas Instrumentsâ€™ MSP430 microcontroller family. Due to its characteristics, the openMSP430 was selected to integrate the System on Chip (SOC) of the project. This open-core, that will be implemented as an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), was previously synthesized, for a SAEDCMOS 90nm target technology process.
