# *SoC-Implementation-of-OpenMSP430-Microcontroller*
*The open- MSP430 is an open-source 16-bit microcontroller core written in Verilog, that is compatible with the Texas Instrumentsâ€™ MSP430 microcontroller family. Due to its characteristics, the openMSP430 was selected to integrate the System on Chip (SOC) of the project. This open-core, that will be implemented as an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), was previously synthesized, for a SAED CMOS 90nm target technology process.*

# *Adding Designware Peripherals*

Within the MSP430 rtl directory, there is a template for both 8-bit and 16-bit peripherals. The templates contain information for adding input and output registers, and handling the decoder for addressing issues. To utilize Synopsys tools even more for this project, a combination divider, DW_div, from the DesignWare library was used to implement a combination divider. The inputs and outputs were mapped to the peripheral registers and an instantiation of the DesignWare divider was added to the bottom of the Verilog module:

```
DW_div #(width, width, tc_mode, rem_mode)
U1 (.a(op1_dividend), .b(op2_divisor), .quotient(quotient_out), .remainder(rem_out), .divide_by_0(div_by_0_out));
```

# *Behaviorial Simulations*

Since simulating every instruction in the core instruction set takes a lot of time, the focus was only on 4 instructions: ADD, XOR, peripheral multiplier, and peripheral divider (custom). The verification for these was performed within ModelSim. A testbench for testing each operation was created.

# *Synthesis with DC*
Within the MSP430 directories from OpenCores, there is a directory including tcl scripts for DC synthesis: openmsp430 --> trunk --> core --> Synopsys Here, a good example of recommended timing, DFT, and constraints are recommended for synthesis.

To verify that the divider used from DesignWare synthesized correctly using standard cells, the schematic was checked:

Within DC compiler, there is a GUI option for creating UPF files from your synthesized design called visual UPF. The UPF file allows for adding power and clock gating options as well as defining power domains. Visual UPF is a more visual and interactive way to build these scripts:
